1] Relationship Between “Product” and “Product_Category” Entities:
In the given diagram, we have two entities: “Product” and “Product_Category.”
The relationship between them is represented by a foreign key. Specifically:
The “Product” entity has an attribute called “category_id,” which serves as a foreign key.
This “category_id” references the primary key “id” of the “Product_Category” entity.
In simpler terms, each product in the “Product” table is associated with a specific category from the “Product_Category” table.
This relationship ensures that products are categorized correctly.



2] Ensuring Valid Categories for Products:
To guarantee that each product in the “Product” table has a valid category assigned:
Non-null Constraint: Make sure that the “category_id” field in the “Product” table is not nullable. This means every product must have a category ID.
Foreign Key Constraint: Use foreign key constraints to ensure that every category ID in the “Product” table corresponds to a valid ID in the “Product_Category” table.
By enforcing these constraints, you prevent products from having invalid or nonexistent category assignments.
